        <article class="about">
            <h2>About Wyatt</h2>
            <p>I was originally drawn towards development because of my curiosity around how programs were made. I jumped in head first and fell in love with the unique problems and problem solving skills that are common in the field. Even now, I’m still excited to learn more and develop my mastery over coding and deployments.</p>
            <p>When I’m away from the keyboard, I enjoy making music, spending too much time in coffee shops, and playing tabletop games with my friends. I’m always ready to talk shop about music or D&D.</p>
